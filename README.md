# Messaging AMQP Contracts

This module defines the **shared contracts** for messages exchanged between applications. 

More specifically, for applications that utilize Spring Boots AMQP.

It includes:
- Message classes, enums, and records representing domain events.
- Queue names and exchange constants to ensure consistent routing.

Its main use-case is found in this custom [Spring Boot AMQP Starter](https://github.com/plaguv/messaging-amqp-starter)

# Dependencies
- `Java LTS >= 17`

# Installation
You can easily add the `fhdw.de:messaging-amqp-contracts` library to your project using **JitPack**.

An additional guide on how to do that is featured [here](https://jitpack.io/#plaguv/messaging-amqp-contracts/Tag).
